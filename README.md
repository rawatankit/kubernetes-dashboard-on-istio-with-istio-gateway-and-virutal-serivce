# kubernetes-dashboard-on-istio-with-istio-gateway-and-virtual-service

In this Repostiory i have added a documentation which will guide to install kubernetes-dashboard on Istio Ingress controller.

In This documentation we are not covering the Istio Ingress installation. we are only covering the k8s-dashboard installation with Read-only user and specific resources permission.

To access to k8s-dashboard we will also create the Istio-Gateway and Istio-Virtual service.
